ABSTRACT:
Roads serve an irreplaceable tool of transportation. Yet, it is the house of tremendous accidents. Some of the reasons for accidents include improper laying and improper maintenance of road surface. The common distress that can affect the performance of road are cracks and damages. Some of the major causes for cracks include excessive loading, poor basement, temperature cycling, improper lay down of road joint parts, etc.. Damages are a greater version of cracks caused over a period of time. Our paper deals with detecting, identifying cracks and damages on road surface, and also classify types of cracks based on its structure, then identifies the location and send the notification to the nearest government road maintenance department officials. Our proposed work deals with designing a model using Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network(Faster R-CNN) and pre-trained model ResNet152. The novelty of our work lies in the addition of Global Average Pooling (GAP) layers before softmax layer. GAP layer is used to overcome the issue of overfitting by reducing the total number of trainable parameters in a model. Outer Ring Road Dataset which used for training and testing our proposed model, is a set of self collected dataset which comprises of 3,533 images. There are five class labels of cracks and damages labelled in the images. The cracks and damages in these images are identified and classified into five types. Results of our experiment turned out to an accuracy of 0.90999.
